<h1>Fine-Tuning a Transformer Model with Hugging Face Transformers Library</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, I fine-tuned a pre-trained Transformer model using Hugging Face's transformers library to perform sentiment analysis on IMDb reviews. The process involved tokenizing data with DistilBERT, training the model, evaluating its performance, and deploying it for sentiment classification tasks.
